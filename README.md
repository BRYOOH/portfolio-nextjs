# MyPortifolio
This is an application showcasing my career with projects done, my experience , stacks used and a contact form to reach out for future projects. The application was inspired during my job hunting period where I had to market myself to tech organisation with a friendly, visually appealing website.

## Technologies used
* __NextJS__ -This is the frontend language used to design the user interface.
* __EmailJS__ - This is a JavaScript library that enables developers to send emails directly from the client side of their web applications without needing to set up a backend serve.
* __3D Objects__ - This objects were used to make the site more modern and visually appealing. The 3D Objects were designed using the **react-three/drei** and **react-three/fiber** libraries.

## Experience
* This is the page where I displayed my previous experiences with a list of the tasks I accomplished in those organizations
* I used the **react-vertical-timeline-component** to display my experiences in a scroll component for better reading

## Projects 
* Here I displayed my top projects both personal and collaborated. I attached a live demo to each project with a link to my github for the full code.
* I used **PinContainer** from __aceternity UI__ to bring the card tilt animation to life. The attached link to each card is the live demo
